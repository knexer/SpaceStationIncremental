# SpaceStationIncremental
A turn-based incremental game about managing and expanding a space station.

You are constrained by a fixed launch budget (one rocket carrying a mixture of cargo and/or passengers per turn), so you will need to use recycling and ISRU technologies to stretch that budget as far as possible.
